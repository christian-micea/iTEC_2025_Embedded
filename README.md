Code I wrote for iTEC (IT Engineering Contest), 2025 edition, for the Embedded Development track.

Important: The code in this repository was speciffically designed for an embedded application, specifically for an ARM STM32 architecture (STM32F407G-disc1). 
Some of the files (ex: .IOC files - STM32CubeMX configuration files) are only useful with specific programs that can run them. 
Additionally, the code itself is made for a hardware application, much like my FTC code, and cannot be properly run without said hardware.
